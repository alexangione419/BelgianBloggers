# Loyalty Lines Project Blog

## Data and Software in International Government Dialogue - Belgium Summer 2025

The European Parliament is the heart of politics within the European Union. Our application seeks to provide insight into the inter-party politics and dynamics between Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and their parties through data visualizations, recommendations, and predictions. With our app, we hope to streamline MEP data by providing exploratory tools for our three user personas: a party leader, a political journalist, and a citizen. All of our app's features use real data to allow for real insights.

We documented our process of developing this application through team posts and individual posts. The team posts describe our timelines and thought processes regarding the user personas, machine learning models, database design, and overall project vison. Our individual posts detail each team member's individual contributions to each phase of the project as well as highlights from our Belgium experience!

Check out our blog for an inside view of how Loyalty Lines was created and see where our heads were at every step of the way.
