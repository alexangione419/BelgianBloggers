# Phase III Individual Deliverable
This week, I focused on building out the core UI pages for our web app. To test the layout and functionality of the graphs, I created mock DataFrames just to visualize how the data would render. These placeholders were helpful for design purposes, though they aren’t connected to the actual data pipeline.

On the backend, I worked on cleaning and standardizing the CSV character data so it could be properly ingested into our SQL models. This step was crucial to ensure that our machine learning models receive clean, structured input.

Although these checks aren’t integrated into the app yet, I also verified that our ML model assumptions were being met, including testing for multicollinearity, residual normality, and consistent variance. These backend validations support the reliability of our model predictions.

Finally, I started drafting my slides for our final presentation, focusing on the architecture, data flow, and the predictive logic driving our application.
