 # Hi, I'm Sienna Boos!

I am a rising sophomore at Northeastern University. My major is Data Science and Behavioral Neuroscience, and I am minoring in Philosophy.

I contributed to Loyalty Lines during a Dialogue of Civilizations in Leuven, Belgium, studying data and software in international government and politics. I am passionate about AI, computational biology, and the ethical and social implications of an increasingly data-driven world.
