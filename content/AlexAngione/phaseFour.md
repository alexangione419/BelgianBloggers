# Phase IV Individual Blog Post

For Phase IV, my contributions included
- Polishing up transactional data routes
- Updating Data Model to match our final project implementation
- Multiple aspects of multiple FE screens, including the MEP infomration, the watchlist backend, the Home use select screen, and smaller parts of others. 


I regret not saying anything at the end of all of the presentations, because I recieved an immense amount of value from this program. Being at the end of my Northeastern Experience, the people I bonded with on this trip, not just the students but Dr. Gerber, Dr. Fontenot, and Syndey, will be relationships I cherish for my lifetime. I will find a way to in the future, but I want to make sure every student knows that as "the old guy" amongst them, they'll forever have an uperclassman they can reach out to for anything they need.
