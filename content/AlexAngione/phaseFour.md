# Phase IV Individual Blog Post

For Phase IV, my contributions included
- Polishing up transactional data routes
- Updating Data Model to match our final project implementation
- Multiple aspects of multiple FE screens, including the MEP information, the watchlist backend, the Home use select screen, and smaller parts of others. 


I recieved an immense amount of value from this program. Being at the end of my Northeastern Experience, the people I bonded with on this trip, not just the students but Dr. Gerber, Dr. Fontenot, and Syndey, will be relationships I cherish for a lifetime. I should have said something at our group reflection chat after the presentations, but I want to make sure every student knows that they'll forever have an uperclassman they can reach out to for anything they need. Dr. Fontenot and Dr. Gerber, you cultivated a special environment of learning, collaboration, and growth, and I will forver remember this trip.
